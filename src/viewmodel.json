      "description": "In a hospital lots of different systems are used and usually they do not work very well together. At the same time systems need to share information with each other and patients and authorities want information regardless of the system that stores the information. To solve this problem we are building a service bus for the county of Västerbotten, based on principles for domain driven architecture, SOA, REST and MicroServices, using .Net and Web API. The service bus handles routing, service discovery and has an engagement index that keeps track of patients and in which system they have data. Although every service is independent of the other a lot of functionality is the same for every service, therefore we created a framework existing of NuGet packages. As part of the project we also build a web portal on top of the service bus that makes the information about the patients accessible for the hospital's employees. In this talk I will discuss the challenges but most important the solutions we are working on to solve those integrations.",

Using extension methods without extension methods, how? How can you get value equality for free? I have a lot of existing C# or VB code. Can I somehow benefit from F#? Finally we will explore tools that you can use to get acquainted with F# scripting and tools which you can use with your existing .NET projects and beyond.",

There are many providers that offer solutions for managing containers for example Google Cloud Platform, Amazon AWS and Mesosphere. This talk will introduce Kubernetes from Google, a orchestration tool that offer automated deployment, scaling and management of your containers. You will learn the core concepts and features of Kubernetes and gain insight in how it differs from similar solutions like Amazon Container Service or Mesosphere. I will also give a live demo of these features. The demo will show how to easily load balance between multiple container instances, auto scale your application and how to do canary releases and rolling upgrades with zero down time.",

Organisations need to be able to harness data, transform it and derive insights and business value from it in order to survive in accelerating competition. This places increasing demands on organisations’ Business Intelligence to deliver innovative solutions enabling the business to create new and increased business value. Demands that that are hard to satisfy without compromising reliability and security in the existing BI landscape. Bimodal BI is about allowing two versions of BI to coexist in an organisation: BI Type I (Performance) and BI Type II (Innovation). The partition intends to give room for an explorative way of working with data-driven innovation while maintaining strict governance and control of daily business critical reporting and analysis work.",

      "description": "How can we harness the power of parallelism to tackle complex problems that can advance our understanding of the universe? The N-body problem is a collection of problems of how objects or particles interact with each other given an initial speed, a direction and a force that acts upon all other ojects (for instance gravity). This is relevant in many aspects of our lives today, like astrophysics, medicine or the simulation of weather patterns. I plan to talk about the N-body problem, and show what a serial and parallel implementation of the problem would look like.",

Machine learning has long been a somewhat academic discipline, its practitioners highly specialized. But with the advent of a new class of commoditized machine learning platforms, MLaaS, Machine Learning as a Service, is now available to all developers. MLaaS can be treated as a black box, giving developers the opportunity to dive into machine learning head first. Supply your own data, build a model using tools supported by your chosen MLaaS platform and train it using the well tested algorithms offered. When ready to dig deeper into the world of machine learning, most MLaaS platforms enables us to develop our own algorithms even better tailored to our data and models. This talk will show you the state of the art of MLaaS, what the different vendors offers, and where you best can put it to use in your applications.",

Getting properly hacked is one of those things that is a lot more comfortable to prevent beforehand than to gather the shattered pieces afterwards. In this talk, we will take a practical approach to good personal digital security. We will start with the easy parts before drilling through the layers of security, down to the parts that are unpredictable and dangerous. Bring your laptop and a tin foil hat. Topics include: What it's like to get properly hacked. Using password managers. Operating system security. Browser security. Encryption, firewalls, factors, and other means of protection. All audiences. No code. All practical application. Perfect if you've watched the show \"\"Mr. Robot\"\" You will hopefully learn to, as they say, \"\"get your shit together\"\" when it comes to personal security.\"",

Cylon.js is a node.js based JavaScript framework for robtics and physical computing. It supports an extensive range of hardware, from remote controlled toys to IoT devices. Cylon.js is great for abstracting away the annoying aspects of hardware coding, leaving the fun part: seeing your code bridge the gap from the digital to the physical world.
