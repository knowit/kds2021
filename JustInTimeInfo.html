You should start thinking about what to attend! We will be updating the conference website with any changes before and during the conference. You can mark the sessions you plan to attend by clicking the heart, as a reminder for yourself.</p><p>If needed, don’t forget to make your own travel arrangements in time!</p><p>The conference is held at<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/sweden/stockholm/scandic-continental"> Scandic Continental Hotel </a>For those travelling to Stockholm by air, we recommend that you take either the<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.arlandaexpress.com/"> Arlanda Express </a>to<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.dinstation.com/stockholm-centralstation/"> Stockholm Centralstation </a>or<a class="paragraphLink" href="https://www.flygbussarna.se/en/arlanda"> airport bus </a>to<a class="paragraphLink" href="http://www.cityterminalen.com/en/"> Cityterminalen </a>.

It is different distances to the restaurants, but it does not take more than 20 minutes to walk. There will be one person in each group who is from the Stockholm office and who can answer questions.</p><p>Hotel rooms:</p><ul><li>Please make sure that the hotel reservation is in accordance with your wishes. A separate mail, titled “Knowit Developer Summit 2021 - Hotel accommodation”, has been sent on this 2021-11-01.
